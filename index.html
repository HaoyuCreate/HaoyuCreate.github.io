Welcome to my website! 

I am a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at New York University, USA. My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **digital signal processing**. During my time at NYU, I have been dedicated to designing advanced learning-based algorithms of object detection and depth estimation in visual SLAM for **autonomous driving system**. Before coming to NYU, I worked as a Research Engineer at New York University Abudhabi, UAE, and researched deep feature representation learning from **medical images** and **point clouds**.


Previously, I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees from Tianjin University, PRC, in 2015 and 2018, respectively, when I kept researching compressed sensing and nonconvex penalty for **digital signal deconvolution and deblurring**. I also developed algorithms of **super-resolution** for 1D/2D signals (Acoustic/Visual signals).
