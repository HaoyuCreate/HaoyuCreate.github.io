Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at New York University, USA. My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **computer vision** and **digital signal processing**. During my time at NYU, I have been dedicated on designing advanced learning-based algorithms of 2D/3D object detection and visual SLAM system for autonomous driving system. Before coming to the NYU, I worked as an Research Engineer at New York University Abudhabi, UAE and conducted researches on deep feature representation learning from medical images and point cloulds.


Previously, I earned my bachelor and master degree in Electical and Informaiton Engineering from Tianjin University, PRC in 2015 and 2018 respectively, when I was keeping doing research on compressed sensoring and nonconvex penalty for **digital signal deconvolution and deblurring**. I also developed algorithms of **super-resolution** for 1D/2D signals (Acoustic/Visual signals).
