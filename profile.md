My name is **Haoyu Fang**, welcome to my personal website. 

I am a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at New York University, USA. My research interest cover machine learning on computer vision and digital signal processing, espeicially human speech enhancement. 



I earned my bachelor degree and master degree from Tianjin University, PRC in 2015 and 2018 respectively.

I am a graduate student in computer science at New York University. My research interest lies in machine vision and machine learning. During my time at NYU I have been developing new methods to better predict scene depth and camera motion in visual SLAM systems. I worked as machine learning intern at Blue River Technology in summer 2020.

Before coming to New York I did my bachelor and master in mathematics at Fudan University where I conducted research on nonconvex penalty for sparse regression problems. I am also interested in the application of statistics and machine learning in the financial industry.
