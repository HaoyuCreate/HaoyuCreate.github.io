  description: Propose an effective strategy that jointly trains 2D segmentation and 3D segmentation networks in a coarse-to-fine manner.  With the 2D segmentation network providing organ-attended data learned from an extensive volume input, the 3D deep network can generate refined segmentation results based on multi-stage visual knowledge.  Besides,  a novel Adversarial Performance Validator (APV) module is applied to the 2D-to-3D pipeline.

  description: Developed a deep network named ContinuityLearner to better learn geometric prior within lane. Specifically, our proposed CNN-based paradigm involves a novel Context-encoding image feature learning network to generate class-dependent image feature maps and a new encoding layer to exploit the geometric continuity feature representation by fusing both spatial and visual information of lane together.
